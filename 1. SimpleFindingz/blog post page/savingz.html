                To save you money, time and tools for the web.

    With all those coupons apps and websites out there it can be time consuming because your always looking for the right deal. As I began couponing, I felt the same way thats why I narrow down my best choices to save not money but time.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm sure you seen those coupons from the Sunday paper and go right by them. Well with those coupons and other sources, you could be saving a lot more money then you think. Here are a few of my favorite ways to help to save & earn money.
    <br>
    <br>
    Besides seeing what they have on sale, another good tip for those who want to save more is to look ahead a time on coupon sites like Krazy coupon lady and coupons.com  to see if they have any sales on items you currently need/want. Don't forget some items may be eligible for cash back so be sure to check and submit those receipts to Ibotta, Checkout51 or any any others if mentioned. Below is a list of some of my favorite and top cash back apps. Who doesn't like free money for shopping that you are already going to do in the first place?

    Apps/Websites
    <br>
      <br>
    Honey- A browser extension that matches and locates the best coupon deal for you. Simply install and during checkout on as you fisnied shopping online, click on the Honey button in your tool bar  and it will automatically apply coupon codes during checkout. It will match other coupons prices to find you the best deal out with just one click.
    <br>
    Lozo-  Finding coupond based on a shoping list to write on the page. They match the best deals for you. Only downside is their isnt an app which makes it less convience to have it on you while your shopping.
    <br>
    Coupons.com- Vairous coupons listed for various products
